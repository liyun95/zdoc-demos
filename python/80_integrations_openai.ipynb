    "This page discusses integrating vector databases with OpenAI's embedding API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will demonstrate how to use OpenAI's [Embedding API](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings) with our vector database to search for book titles. Many existing book search solutions, such as those used by public libraries, rely on keyword matching rather than a semantic understanding of the title's meaning. Using a trained model to represent the input data is known as semantic search and can be applied to a variety of different text-based use cases, including anomaly detection and document search.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get started\n",
    "\n",
    "To follow along, you'll need an API key from the [OpenAI website](https://openai.com/api/). Also, be sure to visit our [cloud landing page](https://zilliz.com/cloud) for free credits that you can use to spin up a new cluster if you don’t have one already.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also need to prepare the data for this example. You can obtain the book titles from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks). Let's create a function that loads book titles from our CSV."
